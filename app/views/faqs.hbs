                  <i class="question">The sample return UDP packets (angle data, rise time data, fall time data) don’t include a frame ID in the header.  This can make it a bit tricky to ensure that frames (a full scan, top to bottom) are correctly assembled, since UDP doesn’t guarantee delivery order.  What’s the proper procedure to follow, to ensure proper frame assembly?</i>
                 
                   <strong class="answer">There are timestamps in the angle packets that can be used to orient which frame packets came from although it is not a frame ID.  Additionally, packets are sent in line order and there are multiple packets per line so even though packets can be delivered out of order, the line number should be a pretty good indicator as to what frame a packet is associated with.  There are multiple range packets per line (at least 3 depending on the number of returns) so a bunch of packets would have to be reordered for range packets to come in with associated with an ambiguous frame.  Hope that makes sense</strong>

                  <i class="question">What do these configuration parameters do?  How does it affect output?  :  ADC Phase Offset, Holdoff, (Blue/Green) Threshold?</i>
                 
                   <strong class="answer">ADC Phase Offset is for adjusting the phasing between odd and even lines with the goal of getting the lines within an eye aligned with each other. Holdoff delay is the amount of time that the G2 control box waits before registering return pulses.  If this is set too large, you lose minimum distance. If it is set too small, you end up with a blank image or an image with weird patterns.  It is typically somewhere around 155 ns, but from unit to unit can vary within the range of 120 to 210 ns.  Thresholds determine the amplitude used to consider a pulse valid.  Too low of a number results in extra noise.  Too high results in a less populated image. </strong>

                   <strong class="answer">From the data it would require being able to identify noise based on the data and adjusting based on the amount of noise received, balanced with the number of returns. </strong>
